# Course Policies

## Academic Integrity

Academic honesty is expected of all students in all examinations, papers, laboratory work, academic transactions, and records. All submissions by a student are expected to be the student’s original work. Material that violates this requirement in any way, or that constitutes any form of dishonesty, cheating, fabrication, the facilitation of academic dishonesty, and/or plagiarism, may result in the student receiving sanctions that include, but are not limited to, appropriate grade penalties, course failure (indicated on the transcript as a grade of ‘E’), course failure due to academic dishonesty (indicated on the transcript as a grade of ‘XE’), loss of registration privileges, disqualification, suspension, and dismissal from the university. Please see the official ASU Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism (Policy Statement 08-02) for more details about the consequences of academic dishonesty. It is accessible online at: [https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity](https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity)  

If students have questions about appropriate submissions or methods of citation or have extenuating circumstances, they should contact their instructor prior to submitting materials and prior to the assignment deadline..

Anyone in violation of these policies is subject to sanctions.

### Electronic Review of Written Submissions 
To ensure compliance with academic integrity policies, written submissions will be submitted to TurnItIn, or a similar plagiarism detection program. Submission of any writing assignment in the course to the professor constitutes consent by the student for the instructor to upload the paper to check against any anti-plagiarism database.

### Generative AI
Before using Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT), confer with your instructor or review the course syllabus for specific information related to the use of Generative AI in the course. For additional information regarding Generative AI at ASU visit the Provost’s page on Generative AI.

### Prohibition of Sharing Copyrighted Materials and Course Content
The contents of this course, including lectures and other instructional materials, are copyrighted materials and, therefore, are protected by federal intellectual property law.  Any unauthorized copying—including video-recording, audio-recording, and stenographic transcription of class lectures—is strictly prohibited.  All rights are reserved by the instructor and Arizona State University. 
 
Students may not upload, sell, or distribute—to any course shell, discussion board, website, or other forum or medium—any course content or any materials that are not the student’s original work, unless the students first comply with all applicable copyright laws. Faculty members reserve the right to delete materials on grounds of suspected copyright infringement. Sharing of assignment submissions and results to websites advertising themselves as “study sites” (e.g. Course Hero) or other similar course information sharing sites are expressly prohibited. Copyright violations will subject students to disciplinary charges for academic integrity and/or Code of Conduct violations.

### Avoiding Plagiarism 

Some students truly do not understand what plagiarism is, and therefore plagiarize unwittingly or unintentionally. But ignorance is not an excuse for unethical academic conduct. To avoid plagiarism, review this tutorial on Plagiarism Awareness and this reference on Avoiding Plagiarism. Moreover, read the following rules that apply regardless of the citation form or style you may be using:

1. _Direct Quotations_ – Whenever you directly quote someone else, you must provide a citation to the source of the material from which you are quoting. Moreover, you must put the material in quotation marks or otherwise set it off in an indented quote so the reader knows what words are yours and what words are quoted. It is unacceptable to use the words of others and only partially quote the original source. This is true even if you provide citations to the source both in text and in your references section!

2. _Paraphrasing/Indirect Quotations_ – Whenever you indirectly quote someone else (i.e., you paraphrase the work of another), you must provide a citation to the source of the material from which you are paraphrasing. Simply changing the structure of a sentence, or a few words in a sentence so that the sentence you write is not an exact quote from the original source does not mean a citation is not needed. This is because the idea you are expressing is not your own, but rather someone else’s.

3. _Using Other’s Ideas_ – Even if you compose an entire paragraph of writing in your own words (i.e., neither quoted, nor paraphrased), if the idea you are expressing in that paragraph is not your own, original idea, you must provide a citation to the source from which you obtained this idea.

4. _Collaborative Work_ – If you collaborate on any work with someone else and fail to acknowledge that collaboration, you are guilty of plagiarism. If you have received permission from your professor to collaborate on some assignment, be sure that all of the contributor's names appear on the submission.

5. _Altering or Revising Another’s Work_ – If you alter or revise the work done by someone and submit that work as your own, you have plagiarized. Similarly, if you allow someone else to alter or revise work that you have done and then allow that person to submit it as his or her own work, you are both guilty of plagiarism. Work that is not entirely your own must be credited by citation, both in text and in your references page.

5. _Altering or Revising Your Own Prior Work_ – You should also be aware that reusing or revising your own work that was prepared for another class or another professor, and not bringing it to the attention of the professor to whom you are submitting the revised work is also academic dishonesty. If, for example, you have two classes that require a term paper, and you can write one paper that meets the requirements of both classes, you may not submit that paper to both professors unless you get permission to do so in advance from both professors. Similarly, if you wrote a paper several semesters ago that can be revised and submitted in satisfaction of a paper requirement for a course in which you are currently enrolled, doing so is academic dishonesty unless you get the advanced permission of your professor to do so. The reason this is dishonest is that it is not an original work prepared in satisfaction for the requirements of the course you are currently taking. Contact your instructor for written approval if you are seeking an exception for unique cases.
