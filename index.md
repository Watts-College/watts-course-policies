# Course Policies

## Academic Integrity

Academic honesty is expected of all students in all examinations, papers, laboratory work, academic transactions, and records. All submissions by a student are expected to be the student’s original work. Material that violates this requirement in any way, or that constitutes any form of dishonesty, cheating, fabrication, the facilitation of academic dishonesty, and/or plagiarism, may result in the student receiving sanctions that include, but are not limited to, appropriate grade penalties, course failure (indicated on the transcript as a grade of ‘E’), course failure due to academic dishonesty (indicated on the transcript as a grade of ‘XE’), loss of registration privileges, disqualification, suspension, and dismissal from the university. Please see the official ASU Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism for more details about the consequences of academic dishonesty. It is accessible online at: [https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity](https://provost.asu.edu/academic-integrity)  

If students have questions about appropriate submissions or methods of citation or have extenuating circumstances, they should contact their instructor prior to submitting materials and prior to the assignment deadline.

### Electronic Review of Written Submissions 
To ensure compliance with academic integrity policies, written submissions will be submitted to TurnItIn, or a similar plagiarism detection program. Submission of any writing assignment in the course to the professor constitutes consent by the student for the instructor to upload the paper to check against any anti-plagiarism database.

### Generative AI
Before using Generative AI (e.g. ChatGPT), confer with your instructor or review the course syllabus for specific information related to the use of Generative AI in the course. For additional information regarding Generative AI at ASU visit the Provost’s page on Generative AI.

### Prohibition of Sharing Copyrighted Materials and Course Content
The contents of this course, including lectures and other instructional materials, are copyrighted materials and, therefore, are protected by federal intellectual property law.  Any unauthorized copying—including video-recording, audio-recording, and stenographic transcription of class lectures—is strictly prohibited.  All rights are reserved by the instructor and Arizona State University. 
 
Students may not upload, sell, or distribute—to any course shell, discussion board, website, or other forum or medium—any course content or any materials that are not the student’s original work, unless the students first comply with all applicable copyright laws. Faculty members reserve the right to delete materials on grounds of suspected copyright infringement. Sharing of assignment submissions and results to websites advertising themselves as “study sites” (e.g. Course Hero) or other similar course information sharing sites are expressly prohibited. Copyright violations will subject students to disciplinary charges for academic integrity and/or Code of Conduct violations.

### Avoiding Plagiarism 

Some students truly do not understand what plagiarism is, and therefore plagiarize unwittingly or unintentionally. But ignorance is not an excuse for unethical academic conduct. To avoid plagiarism, review this [tutorial on Plagiarism Awareness](https://www.asu.edu/lib/tutorials/storyline/plagiarism-awareness/story_html5.html) and this [reference on Avoiding Plagiarism](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/avoiding_plagiarism/index.html). Moreover, read the following rules that apply regardless of the citation form or style you may be using:

1. _Direct Quotations_ – Whenever you directly quote someone else, you must provide a citation to the source of the material from which you are quoting. Moreover, you must put the material in quotation marks or otherwise set it off in an indented quote so the reader knows what words are yours and what words are quoted. It is unacceptable to use the words of others and only partially quote the original source. This is true even if you provide citations to the source both in text and in your references section!

2. _Paraphrasing/Indirect Quotations_ – Whenever you indirectly quote someone else (i.e., you paraphrase the work of another), you must provide a citation to the source of the material from which you are paraphrasing. Simply changing the structure of a sentence, or a few words in a sentence so that the sentence you write is not an exact quote from the original source does not mean a citation is not needed. This is because the idea you are expressing is not your own, but rather someone else’s.

3. _Using Other’s Ideas_ – Even if you compose an entire paragraph of writing in your own words (i.e., neither quoted nor paraphrased), if the idea you are expressing in that paragraph is not your own, original idea, you must provide a citation to the source from which you obtained this idea.

4. _Collaborative Work_ – If you collaborate on any work with someone else and fail to acknowledge that collaboration, you are guilty of plagiarism. If you have received permission from your professor to collaborate on some assignment, be sure that all of the contributor's names appear on the submission.

5. _Altering or Revising Another’s Work_ – If you alter or revise the work done by someone and submit that work as your own, you have plagiarized. Similarly, if you allow someone else to alter or revise work that you have done and then allow that person to submit it as his or her own work, you are both guilty of plagiarism. Work that is not entirely your own must be credited by citation, both in text and in your references page.

5. _Altering or Revising Your Own Prior Work_ – You should also be aware that reusing or revising your own work that was prepared for another class or another professor, and not bringing it to the attention of the professor to whom you are submitting the revised work is also academic dishonesty. If, for example, you have two classes that require a term paper, and you can write one paper that meets the requirements of both classes, you may not submit that paper to both professors unless you get permission to do so in advance from both professors. Similarly, if you wrote a paper several semesters ago that can be revised and submitted in satisfaction of a paper requirement for a course in which you are currently enrolled, doing so is academic dishonesty unless you get the advanced permission of your professor to do so. The reason this is dishonest is that it is not an original work prepared in satisfaction for the requirements of the course you are currently taking. Contact your instructor for written approval if you are seeking an exception for unique cases.

### Accessibility Statement

In compliance with the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504, and the Americans with Disabilities Act as amended (ADAAA) of 2008, professional disability specialists and support staff at [Student Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services (SAILS)](https://eoss.asu.edu/accessibility) facilitate a comprehensive range of academic support services and accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. SAILS staff coordinate transition from high schools and community colleges, in-service training for faculty and staff, resolution of accessibility issues, community outreach, and collaboration between all ASU campuses regarding disability policies, procedures, and accommodations.

### Establishing Eligibility for Disability Accommodations

[Qualified students with disabilities may be eligible to receive academic support services and accommodations](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1560605). Eligibility is based on qualifying disability documentation and assessment of individual need. Students who believe they have a current and essential need for disability accommodations are [responsible for requesting accommodations and providing qualifying documentation](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1560606) to Student Accessibility and Inclusive Learning Services (SAILS).  

Every effort is made to provide reasonable accommodations for qualified students with disabilities. Prior to receiving any disability accommodations, verification of eligibility from SAILS is required. Once registered with SAILS, students with disabilities must meet with the instructor to discuss what reasonable accommodations they will need to be successful in this course. Students with disabilities that are known at the time this course begins are encouraged to make your request for accommodations at the beginning of the semester, either during office hours or by appointment. For disabilities that arise after the course has begun, students should meet with the instructor at the earliest possible time to arrange accommodations for their learning needs. Disability information is confidential.

Qualified students who wish to request an accommodation for a disability should contact SAILS by going to [https://eoss.asu.edu/accessibility](https://eoss.asu.edu/accessibility), calling (480) 965-1234 or emailing [student.accessibility@asu.edu](student.accessibility@asu.edu).

## Attendance and Accommodation of Excused Absences

Attendance and participation in class activities is an essential part of the learning process; thus, students are expected to attend class regularly. Some absences are, however, unavoidable.

**Excused absences** for classes will be given without penalty to the grade in the case of any of the following five reasons: (1) University-sanctioned and/or university-approved activities (e.g., artistic performances, participation in research conferences, intercollegiate athletic activities, student government, required class field trips, etc.); (2) religious holidays; (3) military work performed in the line-of-duty; (4) jury duty or similar governmental obligation (a copy of the summons or other official paperwork must be provided); and (5) illness, quarantine or self-isolation related to illness as documented by a health professional. When any of the first four reasons conflict with class meeting times, students are responsible for informing the professor of the reason for the absence at least one week in advance of the absence.

Accommodations for those assisting in government declared disaster incidents will also be considered. The student should provide the course instructor with an accommodation request accompanied by an explanation of the disaster-related deployment and anticipated timeline for any such deployment.

Excused absences do not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of absence. Faculty will provide accommodations that may include participation in classes remotely, access to recordings of class activities, or make-up work.

If there is a disagreement as to whether an absence should be accommodated, the instructor and student should contact the academic unit chair immediately for resolution.

### Missed Classes Due to University-Sanctioned Activities

In accordance with ACD 304–02, students who participate in university-sanctioned activities that require classes to be missed will be given opportunities to make up examinations and other graded in-class work without penalty, if possible.  However, absence from class or examinations due to university-sanctioned activities does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of the absence. Thus, if making-up with work is not possible, then the student may receive an incomplete contingent upon making arrangements with the professor to complete the final coursework and earn a final grade.

### Accommodation for Religious Practices

In accordance with ACD 304–04, students should notify faculty in advance of the need to be absent from class due to religious observances. The instructor will provide reasonable accommodation of individual religious practices by adjusting the academic environment, without penalty, to provide flexibility. Absence from class or examinations due to religious observance, however, does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of the absence. A list can be found here [https://eoss.asu.edu/cora/holidays](https://eoss.asu.edu/cora/holidays).

Accommodation for Line of Duty
In accordance with SSM 201-18:
1. Line-of-Duty Missed Assignment Make-Up Policy (incomplete or withdrawal not required).

...Students who serve as active duty or reserve military personnel who miss classes, graded assignments, or examinations because of required work performed in the line-of-duty, and this absence does not require the use of the activation for military duty withdrawal policy, shall be given opportunities to make-up examinations and other graded work. However, absence from class or examinations due to line-of-duty activities does not relieve students from responsibility for any part of the course work required during the period of the absence. In addition, because of the potential for a dramatic increase in family-related responsibilities during a deployed spouse's absence, student spouses who are legally responsible for minor dependents should be afforded the same accommodations to make-up missed work when their spouse is deployed. Under this policy, when there is a question as to the validity of the line-of-duty event, Pat Tillman Veterans Center shall determine whether a particular event qualifies as a military line-of-duty activity.

2. Activation for Military Duty (incomplete or withdrawal required).

...A student who is a member of the National Guard, Reserve, or other U.S. Armed Forces branch or is the spouse, as described in the Purpose section of this policy, and is unable to complete classes because of military activation, may request complete withdrawal or course withdrawals, incompletes, or grades, depending on the timing of the activation and the individual student’s needs. Absences resulting from military activation will not adversely affect a student’s catalog year.

...To receive consideration under the military activation policy, a student should complete a Military Activation Form and return the completed form, along with a copy of the military activation order, to the Pat Tillman Veterans Center. The Pat Tillman Veterans Center staff will coordinate the processing of the form for the student, including verification of orders, counseling on available options,  referrals to academic departments, referrals or notification to offices regarding potential refunds, and initiation of processing administrative withdrawals or incomplete grades.

### Accommodation for Illness

If absent for illness, quarantine, or self-isolation for extended periods, reach out to [ASU EOSS Health Services](https://eoss.asu.edu/health) for medical assistance and/or support related to missing classes due to illness. Due to privacy concerns, your instructor will not accept or collect medical documentation. 

## Drop and Add Dates/Withdrawals

This course adheres to a schedule and may be part of a sequenced program, therefore, there is a limited timeline to [drop or add the course](https://students.asu.edu/academic-calendar). Consult with your advisor and notify your instructor to add or drop this course. If you are considering a withdrawal, review the following ASU policies: [Withdrawal from Classes](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1560508), [Medical/Compassionate Withdrawal](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1560509), and a [Grade of Incomplete](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1560530).

## Grade Appeals

Per the [University Policy for Student Appeal Procedures on Grades](https://catalog.asu.edu/appeal), grade disputes must first be addressed by discussing the situation with the instructor. If the dispute is not resolved with the instructor, the student may appeal to the School Director’s official designee, which may include the School’s Academic Grievance Officer or the Associate Director of the School. If the dispute is not resolved at the School level, the student may appeal to the Dean’s official designee. The appeal process is final at the College level.

# Conduct

## Faculty as Mandated Reporters

Course faculty are [mandated reporters](https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/); therefore, anything communicated in class or in a course assignment or assessment that raises concern about safety and/or well-being of a student or another individual or group may be cause for intervention and communication with other university staff and community officials.

## Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Policy Statement

Should you be participating in course work involving health information of clients, you are subject to [HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html) regulations that protect client health information. To comply with these regulations, any client information you present from your internship or work must be de-identified. Any information that would allow someone to determine the client’s identity must be changed or eliminated.  This includes obvious information like names and birthdates. Other information so unique to the person that it will allow for identification may include such variables as diagnosis, race/ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and place of residence.

## Professional Conduct and Civility in the Classroom

Professional conduct is expected in the classroom setting. That is, students should arrive on time for class, be prepared to participate in the class discussion, and show respect for one another’s opinions. College courses bring together a group of diverse individuals with various backgrounds. Students are influenced and shaped by such factors as ethnicity, gender, sex, physical abilities, religious and political beliefs, national origins, and sexual orientations, among others. We expect to learn from each other in an atmosphere of positive engagement and mutual respect. This course may deal with complex and controversial issues that often feel challenging and uncomfortable. We will be exposed to diverse ideas and opinions, and sometimes we will not agree with the ideas expressed by others. Nevertheless, students must engage with one another with civility, respect, and professionalism. Students are encouraged to carefully evaluate their own thinking about violence against individuals of all backgrounds while being mindful of your thoughts of others’ lived experiences.

## Prohibition of Commercial Note Taking Services

In accordance with [ACD 304-06 Commercial Note Taking Services](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1557491), written permission must be secured from the official instructor of the class in order to sell the instructor's oral communication in the form of notes. Notes must have the notetaker's name as well as the instructor's name, the course number, and the date.

## Student Conduct

Required behavior standards are listed in the [Student Code of Conduct and Student Disciplinary Procedures](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1560489), [Computer, Internet, and Electronic Communications policy](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1540286), and outlined by the [Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities](https://students.asu.edu/srr). In addition, 

* All incidents and allegations of violent or threatening conduct by an ASU student (whether on- or off-campus) must be reported to the ASU Police Department (ASU PD) and the Office of the Dean of Students. If either office determines that the behavior poses or has posed a serious threat to personal safety or to the welfare of the campus, the student will not be permitted to return to campus or reside in any ASU residence hall until an appropriate threat assessment has been completed and, if necessary, conditions for return are imposed. ASU PD, the Office of the Dean of Students, and other appropriate offices will coordinate the assessment in light of the relevant circumstances. See Section 104-02 of the Student Services manual for more information.

* [Students are entitled to receive instruction free from interference](https://policy.asu.edu/#doc1560489) by other members of the class. An instructor may withdraw a student from the course when the student's behavior disrupts the educational process per [Instructor Withdrawal of a Student for Disruptive Classroom Behavior](https://public.powerdms.com/ASU/documents/1560510).

* Although you are welcome to disagree with the professor or your classmates, everyone is expected to participate respectfully. Students who engage in personal attacks; who use rude, insulting, or disrespectful language; or who engage in other disruptive or threatening behavior may face disciplinary action. Indeed, an instructor may withdraw a student from a course with a mark of ‘W’ or ‘E’ when the student’s behavior disrupts the educational process. In addition, students may face formal disciplinary action in the Office of Student Judicial Affairs. For more details about the University’s Student Code of Conduct, please visit the following link and read the Arizona Board of Regents Policy Manual Sections 5-301 to 5-404, the terms of which are hereby incorporated by reference into this syllabus:  [https://www.azregents.edu/about/policy-manual]([https://www.azregents.edu/board-committees/policy-manual](https://www.azregents.edu/about/policy-manual)) 

* Appropriate online behavior (also known as netiquette) is defined by the instructor and includes keeping course discussion posts focused on the assigned topics. Students must maintain a cordial atmosphere and use tact in expressing differences of opinion. Inappropriate discussion board posts may be deleted by the instructor.

The Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities accepts [incident reports](https://eoss.asu.edu/dos/srr/filingreport) from students, faculty, staff, or other persons who believe that a student or a student organization may have violated the Student Code of Conduct.

## Title IX: Sex Discrimination, Sexual Harassment, and Sexual Abuse

Title IX is a federal law that provides that no person be excluded on the basis of sex from participation in, be denied benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity.  Both Title IX and university policy make clear that sexual violence and harassment based on sex is prohibited.  An individual who believes they have been subjected to sexual violence or harassed on the basis of sex can seek support, including counseling and academic support, from the university.  If you or someone you know has been harassed on the basis of sex or sexually assaulted, you can find information and resources at [https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs](https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/faqs). 
 
As a mandated reporter, your instructor is obligated to report any information they become aware of regarding alleged acts of sexual discrimination, including sexual violence and dating violence.  ASU Counseling Services, [https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling](https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling) is available if you wish to discuss any concerns confidentially and privately. ASU online students may access [360 Life Services](https://goto.asuonline.asu.edu/360lifeservices/). 
 
ASU provides a dedicated [Sexual Violence Awareness and Response](https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/) website with a variety of resources and educational programs designed to prevent sexual violence and other acts of sexual misconduct, provide information about what to do when an incident has occurred, and increase awareness of campus and community resources for support and response. Victims of sexual violence, sexual harassment, stalking and relationship violence are encouraged to [seek support](https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/resources) and [report](https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/report) the incident. Identify the most appropriate path for your needs using the [Sexual Assault Reporting Options and Resources document](https://sexualviolenceprevention.asu.edu/sites/default/files/2023-05/sexual_assault_flowchart.pdf).
 
For an online tool that is designed to help students who may be experiencing dating violence evaluate their safety, make decisions, and connect to campus and community services, visit: [www.myplanapp.org](http://www.myplanapp.org). myPlan is available for students of all gender identities and sexual orientations. This tool is also for friends who want to support someone they are concerned may be in an abusive relationship.

# Self-Care, Unanticipated Distress and Counseling Services

Throughout the learning that occurs in this course, students are asked to continually and carefully evaluate their own thoughts and feelings, be mindful of their reactions to the material, and practice self-care as needed. Given the nature of the material presented, the emotional content may be difficult. Students may experience unexpected and/or distressing responses to course content and discussions. Please communicate with your instructor if you need support around distress arising from course content. Please also be aware that ASU offers counseling services for enrolled students. For more information, please go to the ASU Counseling Services website:  [https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling](https://eoss.asu.edu/counseling)  or call (480) 965-6146, Monday – Friday 8am – 5pm. After business hours, call the EMPACT ASU-dedicated hotline at (480) 921-1006. [Student Advocacy and Assistance](https://eoss.asu.edu/dos/student-advocacy-and-assistance) in the Dean of Students office guides students in resolving educational, personal and other difficulties by linking students with appropriate university and community resources

## Watts Resources for Essential Needs Office (WREN)

The **Watts Resources for Essential Needs Office (WREN)** is a comfortable space where students may be eligible to receive assistance with identifying and navigating basic needs resources within ASU and their communities. Additionally, students may be able to receive one-on-one assistance with applying to Arizona's Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program [(SNAP)](https://des.az.gov/na) and state health insurance [(AHCCCS)](https://www.azahcccs.gov/). Students may be eligible to receive continued assistance with managing their SNAP and AHCCCS benefits. Please refer to the links below or schedule an appointment with the WREN Office to learn more about these programs! For out-of-state students, WREN can meet virtually and help find the appropriate resources for your state.

The WREN Office utilizes [FindHelp.org](https://www.findhelp.org/) to identify and filter community resources available in the student’s specific zip code. The platform is free and can be accessed by students to search for resources on their own.
 
Our mission is to ensure all students are able to meet their basic needs through access to community and ASU resources in order to thrive at Watts College!

# Workload Expectations 

The Arizona Board of Regents, the governing board for ASU, NAU, and the U of A, has a policy for how much time students should invest in their courses: “A minimum of 45 hours of work by each student is required for each unit of credit.” Therefore, in a 3-credit course, students should expect to invest 45 hours in class meetings (or the online equivalent), as well as 90 hours doing homework and assignments—a total of 135 hours in any given session (A, B, or C). This translates to 9 hours per week for classes that meet over a 15 week-semester. For 7.5-week classes, the workload doubles to 18 hours per week engaging in online activities, reading, doing other homework, completing assignments or assessments, and studying. As you register for courses, keep this 135-hour standard in mind because during some semesters your work and/or family commitments may prevent you from taking a full load of classes.
